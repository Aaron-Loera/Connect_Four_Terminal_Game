# Portfolio Project One
This is my first project and it works just like Connect 4. The only difference being here you don't have to stack the pieces, a player can pick anywhere to place their piece. Other than that the rules are exactly the same, connect 4 pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the other player.
